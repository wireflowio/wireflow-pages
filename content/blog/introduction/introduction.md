Wireflow's goal is to provide a seamless and automated way to manage WireGuard VPNs within Kubernetes environments. By
leveraging Kubernetes' declarative nature, Wireflow allows users to define their desired network configurations using
custom resource definitions (CRDs). The Wireflow operator then takes care of provisioning and managing the underlying
WireGuard tunnels, ensuring secure and efficient connectivity between mutiple platforms. This approach simplifies the
complexity of VPN management, enhances security through automation, and integrates natively with Kubernetes workflows.
